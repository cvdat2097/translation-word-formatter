One is fifteen, and one is eight and I am a kindergarten teacher. At the moment, I don't have any job.

I'm a housewife. [00:12:16-00:12:34] Okay, so it's great that we get to know each other. Let's enter the main topic. Okay, so what do you do in your free time when you are not busy? How do you spend your free time? [00:12:36-00:12:38] I would go out shopping. [00:12:41-00:12:45] Shopping, cooking, taking care of my beauty and go for a massage.[00:12:46-00:12:52] Right. What else do you do? Okay, both go for a massage? [00:12:52-00:12:52] That's right. [00:12:54-00:12:55] Anything else? [00:12:57-00:13:00] Cooking, drink smoothies, beautify skin. Okay. [00:13:01-00:13:04] During the outbreak, I guess you just stay at home. You don't go out, right? [00:13:05-00:13:07] Right. I don't go out.[00:13:11-00:13:14] I normally cook at home during the outbreak. [00:13:16-00:13:22] Let's talk about cooking. So on average, how many times do you cook in a day? [00:13:25-00:13:30] At the moment, I have to go three times a day. I had to go three meals a day because of the outbreak. [00:13:31-00:13:33] Three meals, but normally two meals. [00:13:33-00:13:35] That's right. Normally, two meals.[00:13:42-00:13:52] The children are home. That's why I also have to prepare afternoon snacks as well. They eat fruit? I mean, they eat a lot of things. [00:13:53-00:14:01] Okay. Question. Now for breakfast, what do you cook? What do you cook for breakfast? [00:14:02-00:14:10] Porridge, vermicelli soup, porridge, also glass noodle soup. [00:14:11-00:14:13] Why do you choose those dishes to cook for breakfast?[00:14:15-00:14:17] Because we are used to eating those for breakfast. [00:14:18-00:14:22] That's right. We are used to cooking those for breakfast. [00:14:22-00:14:25] Okay. Anything else?[00:14:29-00:14:33] Oh, also fried rice. I also cook fried rice as well. [00:14:34-00:14:35] That's right. [00:14:39-00:14:42] Or just noodle. Fried rice. [00:14:42-00:14:44] Rice noodle soup, vermicelli soup. [00:14:47-00:14:55] If I still have rice left over, I would fry the rice. I would fry the rice for the next breakfast. [00:15:01-00:15:04] At the moment I'm unemployed. I'm very free, so I can easily cook. [00:15:11-00:15:14] Normally I cook a big pot of rice for the whole day. [00:15:14-00:15:22] So for breakfast you cook something light and easy to cook. What about lunch? What do you cook for lunch? [00:15:24-00:15:33] For lunch, I cooked salty dishes, the main course, so it would be rice served with food or rice served with stir-fry.[00:15:34-00:15:41] Anything else? So normally one soup, one salty dish, one stir-fry, right? [00:15:41-00:15:42] That's right. [00:15:43-00:15:47]What kind of soup do you normally cook?[00:15:51-00:15:53] Vegetable soup.[00:15:59-00:16:00] Anything else? [00:16:01-00:16:18] Or ??? soup, or fish soup, or pork rib soup, or yam soup. Different kinds of soup. also, soup cooked with pork paste, soup cooked with mushroom. [00:16:21-00:16:26] Okay. Do you cook similar or different soup for lunch or dinner? [00:16:38-00:17:00] You know, for example, I would stir fry snail with banana and tofu. Normally I would cook both dishes for lunch and dinner because they’re a special dish. We can have that dish two times a day. Lunch and dinner. [00:17:04-00:17:16] And chicken as well. You know, we also have chicken, so we boiled the chicken. So we normally have chicken leftover. So I can cook several dishes with boiled chicken. [00:17:27-00:17:35] For example, lunch, I would have a soup and a stir-fry. So for dinner, I would change the soup into something else. [00:17:37-00:17:47] It seems you invest a lot of time on cooking, you see. Whereas my family, we only cook once a day. We don’t really change the dishes for lunch and dinner.[00:17:48-00:17:51] But I do. I do change the dishes for lunch and dinner. [00:18:44-00:19:21] Okay. Another question. You cook several dishes. How do you actually prepare? I’m going to show you the following methods here, and you’re going to tell me if you are still using these methods. Okay? First would be grinding, you know, wet condition, paste-like grinding. Do you actually use this method. Do you grind?[00:19:21-00:19:52] Yes. Yes, I do. I do grind. It's always easier to grind with water in it. If I grind it without water, I would have to shake it. Say when I grind a avocado, I would add a little bit of hot/warm water in it. And it's going to be ground is easily. [00:19:57-00:20:05] Apart from grinding fruit to make smoothie, are there any other ingredients you also grind wet? [00:20:05-00:20:08] I grind squid.[00:20:09-00:20:10] But you have to add water? [00:20:10-00:20:12] No, I don't need to add water. [00:20:12-00:20:24] That is not grind. That is actually mincing. Like pepper, you know the container to mill the pepper. You don't have to add water in.[00:20:28-00:20:49] And I also grind dry mushroom. If I use a small one to grind the mushroom, I don't have to add water in. So when I grind the mushroom, I don't have to worry about adding water in.[00:20:53-00:20:53] Anything else?[00:20:58-00:21:05] But actually when I mince the fresh pork, I don't actually add water in. I use a small one. [00:21:09-00:21:18] Anything else? Ah, the small container is for dry mincing or dry grinding. That's right. [00:21:25-00:21:31] It depends on what kind of equipment. [00:21:39-00:22:44] When it comes to cooking, you are so passionate. You are so excited. But let's agree on one thing. When one person talks, the next person please keep quiet. Otherwise, you know, no one can listen to to the conversation. Okay? Otherwise you are going to stay here until 7:00 PM, okay? I understand you all have your own method, and you also have your own tips so you can actually embrace your opinion, and because we don't have different tips, let's summarize. Grinding with water, wet writing. That is for smoothie, and for grinding squid, grinding fish. So any water and not any water, does it make a difference?[00:22:45-00:22:49] With water, the ingredient is ground faster.[00:22:49-00:23:04] Save time. Okay, got it. The second method is chopping. In the North you would call “băm,” right? Chopping. Okay. [00:23:05-00:23:07] I used to chop. [00:23:07-00:23:10] Do you still chop or you no longer chop? You still chop? [00:23:13-00:23:19] No, I have a blender now so I don't need to chop by my hands anymore. I don't need to chop anymore. [00:23:22-00:23:44] So before you need chopping, but now you can just put everything in a blender, right? No need to chop anymore? Okay. Is there anything you have to chop at the moment? Say, is there anything you cannot put in the blender and you have to chop by your hands? [00:23:45-00:23:58] No. Everything you can put in the blender nowadays. I can put most of the things in a blender. Whatever I needed to chop before I can put it in the blender now.[00:23:58-00:24:08] Okay. Another question. Another method which is slicing. Slicing. So what kind of things do you have to slice? [00:24:16-00:24:17] I had to slice meat. [00:24:18-00:24:27] Apart from slicing, what else do you have to do? What else do you slice? Anything else that you have to slice?[00:24:32-00:24:34] I actually slice boiled pork meat. [00:24:36-00:24:49] Okay. Question. So the things that you have to slice, why do you have to slice them? Why don't you grind them? Why do you have to slice them? How would you want it to be. How do you slice? [00:24:50-00:24:58] Because I need a thin slice. Yeah. I need a think slice so that’s why it’s impossible to use a blender to do it.[00:24:59-00:25:00] Okay. Anything else? [00:25:00-00:25:19] So I just slice. Make it very thin. Slicing. And that is for stir-fry. Say, I have to slice meat to stir-fry. To slice ham, or boiled pork.[00:25:23-00:25:31] It’s impossible to use a blender in this case. I want to slice, I want the shape to be a thin slice. [00:25:31-00:25:36] Okay. Got it. Anything else?[00:25:47-00:25:50] If you grind everything gonna be so minced. [00:25:50-00:25:57]  Okay. The next one is here. The next one is pounding. You still pound? [00:26:00-00:26:03] Is it just similar to griding? [00:26:05-00:26:09] I believe. It's like smashing. Grinding.[00:26:10-00:26:17] I don't. I actually use the the blender instead. Yes. I use the blender instead.[00:26:23-00:26:31] Is that pounding by myself? By my hands? I use the blender. The blender can actually replace. [00:26:32-00:26: Okay. Is there any dishes that you cannot use a blender to pound, to grind, but you have to use your own hands to pound? [00:26:43-00:27:04] No. No. No. Ah. Actually if what I cook soup with the fruit called “sấu,” at that time I would use something  to pound on the fruit to crush it. I cannot use a blender to grind it. [00:27:06-00:27:09] Okay. Is there anything else? Anything else?[00:27:15-00:27:15] No.[00:27:23-00:27:24] Anything else? No.[00:28:06-00:28:23] Okay. Okay. So can you please tell me, is there anything else you'd have to smash or pound instead of using a blender, instead of using machine?[00:28:25-00:28:40] Because different people use it differently. Say, you actually have to pound the beef before you make beefsteak. [00:28:42-00:28:46] Okay. Anything else? Is there anything else?[00:29:22-00:29:49] Okay. Question. The next one is milling. Dry condition, like pepper, or making into powdery form, say, you know, pepper or chili. Okay. Do you have to do that by hands, or do you use a machine to do it, say, when you want to mill pepper or chili?[00:29:51-00:29:58] I also have that machine, you know, the small container is for milling dry. [00:29:58-00:29:59] That's right. [00:30:00-00:30:01] Anything else?[00:30:06] But it depends. You know, some kind of spices I actually mill or pound. I do pounding. [00:30:17-00:30:26] Okay. Got it. Another question. So at the moment, how do you actually mill pepper or chili? [00:30:28-00:30:43] I put in that blender because the blender actually comes in two different containers, the big one and the small one. So the small one is for pepper or chili. [00:30:46-00:30:57] I heard some people saying that you don't want to use a small one for milling the garlic or pepper, because you don't want it to be smelly. Do you have the same problem? [00:31:00-00:31:31]  I know the smell stills remain in the container. Anyway, that kind of smell is not very bad. It doesn't stay until the next time you use it. It would be gone after. Unless you use it to mill pepper, but it doesn't last for a long time. When you wash it, everything is gone. I believe it's gone after you wash it. [00:31:34-00:32:07] The next one is mixing. At the moment, are you still mixing? Do you still the food or do you have machine to mix the food? Mixing in general, it's like mixing salad, mixing flour. So for mixing, do you still use your hands to mix or do you have a machine that mixes? For sample, for mixing, what kind of things do you mix? What do you mix? [00:32:08-00:32:09] The salad. [00:32:09-00:32:10] Yes. And? [00:32:11-00:32:12] Salad.[00:32:11-00:32:13] Anything else? [00:32:13-00:32:20] Or the spring roll filling. I have to mix by hands. [00:32:24-00:32:31] Or mixed vermicelli, the mixed glass noodles. Those dishes need my hands to mix.[00:32:31-00:32:46] Okay. Got it. Anything else? Okay. Another question. Are you still mixing flour to bake cake or the flour nowadays is already mixed before you purchase?[00:32:52-00:32:53] I still use my hand to mix. [00:32:53-00:33:15] Okay. Now the next one is the next one is whipping. You can whip cream or eggs. For decorating or for cake. For baking, do you still whip? [00:33:15-00:33:22] If I want to whip egg, I would use the egg mixer. I use that machine to whip the eggs.[00:33:34-00:33:44] Is there anyone else who still uses their hands to whip?[00:33:45-00:33:49] Yes, I still have to whip the eggs.[00:33:58-00:34:08] So I would use chopsticks to whip the eggs. Then I would fry the eggs with sticky rice and meat. [00:34:15-00:34:22] Only for the cream for baking would you use the egg mixer, right? The egg whipper? [00:34:22-00:34:22] Yes. [00:34:23-00:34:33] Okay. And you said that if you use the blender to whip, it would not be as good as the egg mixer. Why?[00:34:35-00:35:34] Because if I use the mixer, it would mix the eggs until the eggs release some foam. I can see the layer of foam. If I use my hand to whip, I think it’s not completely dissolved. Whereas if I whip using the machine, there will be a layer of cream on top of the eggs. But sometimes you know when you whip the eggs, in the beginning, you will see a layer of foam, but later on, the eggs will be separated and there will be a layer of water at the bottom. [00:35:35-00:36:16] Okay. Next method is mincing. So you're going to mince, but it's not like watery mincing. You don't have to add any water in. Do you actually use it? Because you told me about mincing fish and squid. When you mince the meat, you don't add water in. Do you use anything to mince? [00:36:16-00:36:16] Yes. [00:36:17-00:36:18] Do you? [00:36:19-00:36:20] Yes. [00:36:26-00:36:28] Yes, I do. [00:36:30-00:36:31] I also do that. [00:36:34-00:36:45] Another question. Water in or not adding water in to mince, does it give different results? [00:36:47-00:36:49] When I mince meat, I don't add water in. [00:36:50-00:36:53] I don't add water in. [00:37:08-00:37:16] When I mince the meat, I must use the small container for dry grinding. [00:37:20-00:37:21] And anything else? [00:37:21-00:37:31] There are two types of container. If I use the small container, I don't add water. If I use the big container, I add water. [00:37:44-00:38:39] Okay. So question. When I asked you about a method, when I raise the method, you're going to tell me how often you use it and the tool, the device you use, and what are the expectations and also the pain point, anything that made you feel unpleasant. Okay? Anything that upset you, alright? Okay. So first of all… Now think about a method in which you often use out of the things you shared with me, okay? So we have here grinding, chopping, slicing, pounding, milling, mixing, mincing. Out of all those methods, what do you often use? What method do you use the most?[00:38:40-00:38:40] Mincing. [00:38:41-00:38:41] Mincing. [00:38:42-00:38:47] Okay. Mincing. What come next? What is the best method? [00:38:48-00:38:48] Grinding. [00:38:49-00:38:57] Okay. Mincing, grinding and what else? So, mincing without water?[00:38:57-00:38:58] That's right. [00:38:58-00:39:04] Second would be grinding with water. Anything else?[00:39:07-00:39:10] Slicing. Yeah, I slice a lot. [00:39:11-00:39:12] Slicing. That's right. [00:39:12-00:39:14] What is the next popular method? [00:39:17-00:39:18] Mixing. [00:39:19-00:39:27] The next one is mixing. Is there anything else also popular? [00:39:34-00:39:35] Slicing.[00:39:39-00:39:39] Slicing? [00:39:40-00:39:40] Yeah. [00:39:41-00:39:59] Yes. We have slicing here. No, I'm asking you about the method. I don't want to ask if you use the blender or not, but I want to ask which method did you use most often? So we hav,e here, grinding, mincing, slicing, and mixing and?[00:40:04-00:40:05] Whipping, right? [00:40:06-00:40:07] Whipping, that's right. [00:40:08-00:40:13] After mixing,  it would be what? [00:40:14-00:40:17] Tearing. Shredding. [00:40:18-00:40:21] What is that for, shredding and tearing? [00:40:22-00:40:25] I can shred chicken or meat. [00:40:25-00:40:59] Oh, you can shred pork. You can also shred chicken. Right. Let me write it out. I want to ask one at a time. The most popular method is mincing, and then grinding, and then slicing, and then next one is mixing. And the next one is… what is the next one?[00:41:03-00:41:06] Whipping the egg?.[00:41:07-00:41:07] Yes. [00:41:07-00:41:21] And the next one is shredding, right? Okay, question. For mincing, without any water in, what kind of ingredients did you mince? What kind of thing do you mince? [00:41:22-00:41:32] Well, vegetables, squid, pepper, seafood, and spices.[00:41:33-00:41:35] Anything else? What else do you use? [00:41:35-00:41:37] Crab. Fish. [00:41:37-00:41:46] Crab. Fish. Okay. Any of the dishes you use the mincing method for? [00:41:47-00:42:22] For mincing all ofthe spices. Say, if I want to prepare the salt mixture for dipping chicken, I have to roast the salt and pepper and other spices. I have to grind them up. And actually I do have to grind in order to make chicken pan fry with salt.[00:42:26-00:42:34] How often would you use it? How often do you use mincing?[00:42:35-00:42:36] Six times a week. [00:42:37-00:42:38] Yeah. Six times a week.[00:42:38-00:42:39] Every day? [00:42:39-00:42:41] Yes. Almost every day. [00:42:44-00:42:58] So when you use mincing, apart from the blender, are there any other tools that help you?[00:43:03-00:43:16] I still have to use chopsticks, bowl, knife, chopping board. You still have to use knife and chopping board to cut the ingredients into small pieces then mince. [00:43:17-00:43:21] Why don't you just prepare everything and add in all at once? [00:43:23-00:43:48] Because I want to make sure everything is thoroughly minced, and I really want to ensure the blender durability. I really want my blender to last for a long time. [00:43:58-00:44:05] And when I slice to grind the meat later, I just use a very, very small amount. [00:44:11-00:44:16]  Is that actually true? Are you afraid it wouldn’t able to to work? [00:44:17-00:44:17] Right.[00:44:17-00:44:18] I think so too. [00:44:23-00:44:47] If there's a container like this, it can actually contain about 100 grams. So if I reduced the amount of meat I wanna mince every time, I believe the blender would be much durable. It would last longer. So I have to cut the meat, but I don't want to cut it too small. It should be just right. [00:44:52-00:45:04] Another question. If there is a kind of blender in which you don't actually have to cut, would you prefer it? [00:45:05-00:45:06] I really want that.[00:45:06-00:45:09] Yeah, I really wanted that kind of blender. It’s really, really necessary. [00:45:13-00:45:14] It’s really necessary.[00:45:17-00:45:46] But I wonder if that blender is big or small because I don't have a big kitchen. I don't want a too big blender. Because apart from the blender, I also have a microwave and then a big dishwasher. And if I have a very big blender, I don't even know where to put it. I don't need it to be too big. [00:45:47-00:46:04] What about you, Hương? Do you need a blender that can cut for you, that can chop for you? Do you want a blender like that?[00:46:09-00:46:14] If I just think for my family, I don't want it to be big size. [00:46:16-00:46:25] Maybe I want… actually I want more programs. Yeah. Same size, but more programs. [00:46:28-00:46:42] I don't want the container to be big because it's already big and heavy. I don't need it. I want the same size, same weight, but it’s truly, truly good. [00:46:45-00:46:57] Let's go to another method: grinding. So, when you grind something with water, what is that for? What kind of ingredients and what dishes you cook? Thủy… Thùy? You.[00:47:11-00:47:31] So for grinding, I actually use it for making smoothies, making smoothies with fresh milk. In order to make my smoothie, I must add water. Whatever I do with the big container, I must add water in. [00:47:32-00:47:41] Okay. What about you, Hằng? Is there anything else do you use? Is there anything else do you grind? Anything else? [00:47:42-00:47:45] I also grind rice. [00:47:46-00:47:48] Why don't you grind rice?[00:47:53-00:47:57] Rice is actually ground in the small container, not the big container. [00:48:00-00:48:01] Okay. Anything else? [00:48:03-00:48:16] It is convenient. Well for example, porridge, which is already cooked, so I put in the blender and grind it to make it really, really fine. And I also grind vegetable. [00:48:16-00:48:17] What kind?[00:48:18-00:48:22] The green leaf vegetables, bok choy, ??? vegetable. [00:48:23-00:48:36] Okay, question. So for this kind of grind, how often do you do it? How often do you grind? [00:48:39-00:48:55] Maybe a few times a week, but almost every day. When the child was little, every day. I use the blender almost every day, especially I grind the porridge.[00:48:56-00:49:17] Okay. Another question. For grinding, apart from the blender, what else do you use? You have a knife. You can slice it. So slicing with knife. What about for grinding? What do you need apart from the blender?[00:49:22-00:49:35] If I want something that is ground and small-sized, I also use something to stir up. Whether it is inside the container, I do stir it up.[00:49:41-00:49:43] Anything else?[00:49:48-00:49:50] Another question. [00:49:51-00:49:56] Well, there is actually a tool to stir and it's attached to the lid. [00:49:56-00:49:59] Is it the one you're talking about, the one for stirring? [00:49:59-00:50:07] Yes. The one for stirring. It’s actually a stick and I can use it to stir. [00:50:43-00:50:44] Is there anything else?[00:50:53-00:51:00] So the new one has the lid and an attached stick for me to stir. [00:51:00-00:51:09] Okay. Now the next one is slicing. What kind of things do you slice? What kind of things do you slice? [00:51:09-00:51:16] Actually, I slice vegetable, fruit and meat. Everything. [00:51:18-00:51:19] Okay. You slice everything? [00:51:20-00:51:21] That's right. [00:51:22-00:51:23] Anything else?[00:51:29-00:51:34] I understand you use knife to slice. Is there anything else you also use for slicing?[00:51:35-00:51:37] Knife. Chopping board. [00:51:37-00:51:40] Anything else that you use for slicing? [00:51:40-00:51:40] Scissors. [00:51:41-00:51:42] What else?[00:51:48-00:51:52] The peeling knife. Oh, the peeling knife as well. That’s right.[00:51:55-00:52:03] When you slice, what kind of expectation do you have?[00:52:11-00:52:25] For example, when I make stir-fry vegetables, I actually trim the vegetables into the flower shape. I slice and also trim the vegetables to make them become flowers, flower shape.[00:52:29-00:52:46] Well understood. Ah, got it. So another question. So we have grinding and mincing. What do you expect the ingredients, or how do you want the ingredients to be? [00:52:47-00:53:22] I want the ingredient to be finely ground, finely minced. It depends on how long I grind or how long I mince. But once I grind or mince, I really wanted to be finely, finely minced or ground. Okay. Whenever I grind meat, I also add pork paste in. I really want the meat and the pork paste to be mixed well. So that’s when I really to make it very, very fine. [00:53:24-00:53:25] Anything else?[00:53:27-00:53:35] So if I don't grind it properly, it's going to be just like chopping.  [00:53:37-00:54:08] So how do you actually adjust that? How do you adjust the machine? Question, another question. So when grinding, or when mincing, do you encounter any pain points, any difficulties?[00:54:16-00:54:54] When I use a small container to mince, sometimes when I put too much ingredients inside the container, at that time, the machine cannot work well. If I don't put a lot into the container, I have to do it many times, to repeat mincing many times because the container too small, it cannot contain a lot. So I really want the container to be more convenient. That's right. Really want it to be more convenient.[00:54:58-00:54:59] Anything else?[00:55:03-00:55:21] Probably I really want a kind of container like this. It's gonna rotate towards the left side and then it’s going to spin towards the right side. It's going to go back and forth like that, so you can mince and stir at the same time, so the ingredients would be thoroughly mixed.[00:55:22-00:55:30] Okay. What about you, Thủy and Hương? Do you know any kind of blender that can work like how she describes?[00:55:35-00:55:47] Even when my machine doesn't do that, the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, so it's okay. I wouldn't need a machine like that. I wouldn't need a blender like that. [00:55:47-00:55:53] The next method is mixing,. So what kind of thing do you mix?[00:55:57-00:56:14] If I want a make salad, I can mix the vegetables to make salad. Mixing is when I mixed salad. [00:56:18-00:56:30] Another question. When you mix a dish, what do you use for mixing? What do you actually use for mixing? [00:56:30-00:56:33] I use the rubber gloves. I use chopsticks to mix.[00:56:35-00:56:36] Rubber gloves and chopsticks. [00:56:40-00:56:41] And what else? [00:56:43-00:56:48] Rubber gloves and… [00:56:50-00:57:15] So the main ingredient for mixing is your hands. So why do you actually use your hand to mix? What don’t you use something else to mix? Why? Why not something else?[00:57:19-00:57:24] If there's something else for me to help me mix, it's going to be great. [00:57:25-00:57:26] Anything else? [00:57:28-00:57:33] I want something like a blender, but it also can mix. [00:57:36-00:57:45] So after you mix, what kind of results do you want? [00:57:48-00:57:52] I really want the ingredients to absorb, to be blended well. [00:57:53-00:57:57] Okay. Anything else? Is there anything else?[00:58:03-00:58:08] I really want something to be mixed together. [00:58:08-00:58:44] Okay. Is there anything else? Is there anything else? Okay. Another question. Whipping. Apart from whipping the eggs, anything else do you whip? [00:58:4-00:58:45] Um, no. [00:58:46-00:58:56] Question. For whipping, how do you actually whip? Anything else that you whip? [00:58:56-00:58:58] I used a chop stick to whip the eggs. [00:58:58-00:59:01] Okay. And what else? [00:59:03- I know there is a kind of mixer. It’s by hands, not a machine[MOU1]. It’s for whipping the eggs for baking cake.. Okay.[00:59:13-00:59:20] How many people here use chopsticks to whip? How many people here use the egg mixer? You raise your hand because… [00:59:21-00:59:21] Chopsticks.[00:59:21-00:59:21] Chopsticks. [00:59:22-00:59:29] Ah, you raise your hand because you’re using chopsticks. Five people use chopsticks, and you? What about you? [00:59:30-00:59:31] I have a machine. [00:59:31-00:59:35] Ah, the egg mixer, right? But is that the manual one or the machine? [00:59:35-00:59:36] Manual.[00:59:36-00:59:47] Ah, the tool. So why do you have to use your hand to whip the egg? Why don't you put it in the blender?[00:59:55-01:00:43] For example, if I use the blender to mix the egg, to beat the egg, I'm afraid it's gonna raise so quickly. If I use my hand… I really want to feel the texture of the egg when we eat the egg. That's what I want to use my hand to whip. If I use the machine, it's going to be so fine. [01:00:43-01:00:53] Okay. What about chopsticks? Why do you use them to whip the egg? Why don't you use the blender or the whipping tool?[01:00:58-01:01:06] It is more convenient. I'm cooking, so it's more convenient to use chopsticks to whip the egg. Then I can fry it right away.[01:01:07-01:01:35] Whipping, frying very fast. Okay, so you're using the egg whipping tool, and using chopsticks, which is good because it doesn't make the egg so finely whipped. So chopsticks or the egg mixer, is there any pain point when you are using the manual tools to whip? Any difficulties?[01:01:41-01:01:46] If I use the blender to whip the eggs, I may have to wash the machine. [01:01:47-01:01:50] Okay. Anything else?[01:01:53-01:01:58] There’s actually no pain point. It's pretty simple. [01:02:04-01:02:21] Anything else? Okay. Last thing is shredding. Apart from shredding chicken, what else do you also shred? [01:02:22-01:02:26] I also shred dried beef and dried fish. [01:02:28-01:02:29] What else? [01:02:30-01:02:36] I also shred dried squid. Grilled dried squid. [01:02:38-01:02:44] So how often do you have to shred the ingredients? How often?[01:02:45-01:02:46] Maybe once or twice a week. [01:02:47-01:02:48] Only once or twice a week. [01:02:48-01:02:49] Anything else?[01:02:52-01:03:00] Sometimes I sit down with my husband and we would grill squid and I shred the squid and drink beer with my husband. [01:03:02-01:03:03] About once a week? [01:03:04-01:03:05] Yeah, about once a week.[01:03:11-01:03:15] If I strapped by hand, the children really enjoy eating. [01:03:17-01:03:30] Another question. When you shred, do you use your hand or anything else to shred? Hand or anything else to shred?[01:03:40-01:03:54] For sample, if I want to make dried pork, I would use my hand to shred and I've got very big pieces after shredding. After that I put in the blender to grind. [01:03:54-01:04:03] Ah, okay. What about the others? Apart from using your hands, are there any other way to shred? [01:04:04-01:04:04] Just hands? [01:04:05-01:04:06] Yeah, just hands. [01:04:07-01:04:12] What about you, Thủy? You shred squid. What do you use to shred squid?[01:04:19-01:04:30] Actually I use a tool to pound. I actually use a stick and I pound and that is how I shred meat. [01:04:35-01:04:43] What about you, Nguyệt Anh? What do you want to say? Is there any other tool that you use to support you when shredding?[01:04:52-01:04:53] Any way? [01:04:53-01:04:54] Any way. [01:04:55-01:05:09] So when you shred something, what are your expectations? How would you want the food to be? [01:05:10-01:05:14] I want it to be finely shredded. [01:05:14-01:05:16] Is there anything else you want? [01:05:17-01:05:18] No, nothing.[01:05:18-01:05:25] What is the biggest pain point when shredding? [01:05:30-01:05:32] Time consuming. It's really, really time consuming. [01:05:35-01:05:36] It really takes a lot of time. [01:05:37-01:05:58] Okay. Another question. So when using the blender in cooking, what is the biggest pain point in general? [01:05:59-01:06:03] Washing. I am so afraid of washing. [01:06:03-01:06:04] That’s right.[01:06:07-01:06:12] Yeah. Whenever the food stuck in the blades, that takes a lot of time. [01:06:14-01:06:29] I guess you all have different pain points. Can you share with me your pain points? Thủy, can you keep talking about that?[01:06:38-01:06:59] For example, when I use it to grind meat, the tendon of the meat would be stuck into the blades. That is the pain point. I have to remove all of the tendon that stuck into the blades before I wash. That’s why it takes a long time. [01:07:00-01:07:05] Okay. What about you, Nguyệt Anh? What are the difficulties? What are the pain points?[01:07:06-01:07:17] Similar to Thủy? Especially when I grind meat with tendon. At that time, the tendon gonna be stuck between the blades. [01:07:19-01:07:22] Ah, okay. Washing again. What about you, Thùy Anh? [01:07:23-01:07:38] Me too. Cleaning the blade is a pain point. I always have to use a toothbrush and I brush it. [01:07:45-01:07:53] Okay. What about you Hằng? When you use the blender, is there any pain point? [01:07:54-01:07:56] No. No new pain points. [01:07:56-01:07:56] The same? [01:07:57-01:08:02] Yes. Same pinpoints. Washing, removing the tendon, washing the blades. [01:08:02-01:08:03] What about you, Hà? [01:08:06-01:08:11] I’m using this kind of blender, but it's so easy to wash. [01:08:30-01:09:03] I used to have another blender in which anytime I want to wash, I would have to remove each part, but at the moment, I'm using a kind of blender in which it has the blades which are very distant from the bottom. That's why the meat doesn’t get stuck in between. [01:09:05-01:09:06] Is there any pain point? [01:09:07-01:09:10] I don't have any pain points. I don't have any difficulties. Well, the small, a container is very small.[01:09:18] The small one is very small. Okay. If I want to mix about one kilo of meat, it takes a lot of time. It takes so long to finish mixing. Okay. Well understood. Mmm. It takes so long.[01:09:38] I really want the small container to be bigger. I can actually well moons, quite a lot of meats at a time. Well understood. And I don't want to shame. I wanted to be able to turn the food from side to side, upside outside the sign. It's the any other pay pawn is that needed to contain who[01:10:05] my mind is so easy to talk to you to wash. Nothing difficult. Very easy, very, very easy to wash. Okay, got it. I'm not going to mention three and, huh? So when you use your Brando, when you use the small container to to mix, it's so small. Why don't they get the big goTenna? Why do you have to use the small one?[01:10:37] How are they different?[01:10:42] The big one is only for Smurfy. Yeah. The big one is only for us. We'll see. My LMA may send it and it had the big container for making a smoothie and a small one is for non water. Non-water MIS. Okay,[01:11:02] so what if I want to grind, try, I'd like to use a small one. I can not use the big bump one. Fuck grinding dry him last right. Anything else?[01:11:18] why con you use the big container? What can you use a big container? No, cannot, cannot use a big contender because the  cannot be used to grind a bean, Bryce, et cetera. The big one is only . The boom. Why Sony first movie. Okay, well understood. Last, why? Well, I've really want the the brand or to be more improved.[01:11:53] Okay. Why? What does the anything else, anything else? Okay. Is there anything else?[01:12:08] Well.[01:12:11] I think each of them has a different, has a different use. The small one is as specializing in grinding dry. Okay. And the big one is best specializing in grinding wet. Okay. Well understood.[01:12:46] And the thing is,[01:12:50] you know, when I, when, when, when I use the small one to mix meat I say I cannot tell him the meat upside down. So sometimes you know what though? The pot contact, the knife can be mixed or the power top cannot be mixed. You see, I cannot turn it, I can not mix it though. It can be the yen. That's the reason why I can never put a lot of meat in the container.[01:13:15] Okay. I really want some, I don't even want to kind of Fauchon in which I can, I can stop there. The, I can still everything upside down. Okay. Well understood. Can you imagine if there is, if there's no Brenda in life, how would that feel cooking job become.[01:13:40] At that time, the cooking channel become very, very difficult. Okay. Is that an ambitious, is that an ingredient that you cannot go at own if you don't have the bladder?[01:14:04] So if I want to make poppies, I can, I've met with this. And if I knows I cannot use I can not make the pop mins. Okay. Anything else I can add? Make popcorn. Okay, well I can not mess musi right, but it's okay. I still can mix the meat. Now listen a path from now, pop paste. I cannot smoothly. Is there anything else that you cannot do at home or you could spend more time to make without the blender?[01:14:47] Is there anything you cannot do at own? Small fee. Impossible to my . Okay.[01:15:00] Anything else? Sorry. And I could not, I bet you is.[01:15:12] Okay. I am going to show the picture of the current blender you have at home and her. Can you please look in the Brando and can you please explain the reason why you chose the blender, the reason why you like the Brando and when you using Marando, anything you like, anything you dislike. So, so when you see your Brando, please, um.[01:15:39] Please describe the vendor to me. I'm going to share the screen. You see this? This one is my blender tree. Yes. Your name is three? Yes. Okay. Now start from you. Start from you please. Why do you buy it? Well, I buy it because . The big container and that actually to two container and both are pretty big, especially the small one.[01:16:21] Okay. Anything else?[01:16:29] And I can actually use it for different purposes. And, you know, there are so many buttons and I can choose different, um. Now bone upgrading. Okay. Finally, Brian Brown, all roughly ground. How much do you pay for it? More than 1 million. Okay. More than 1 million. Yes. Why did you chose Philip[01:16:56] I chose Philip because Philip is a famous brand. Yeah. Is trusted by a Vietnamese is a famous brand. Okay.[01:17:10] It has a pretty big capacity. Big container, small container. I both big. Any other reason? Any other reason why you choose it[01:17:23] and the brand is, well, I chose because of the brand and I choose because you know, the contender is very solid. The container is design looking very solid and I set on buttons. So it actually has seven on buttons. Okay. Well, and is the question,[01:17:50] how do you know while the buttons, actually there are seven but 10 is 44 Cara speed. High speed. Low speed. Okay. Well understood. And[01:18:09] And it's very simple to use. Okay. It is very simple to use. How many years have you been using this fun? Many years. Two years. Three years? Sorry. When you purchased this, Brenda, is there any, and they attach that come together? No. Out of 10 how many squatter you give this. Hold on. 10 comedies garner, you give this eight score.[01:18:43] Why do you reduce to score? How do I do to score? Because I'm not very happy with the with the small, pretty small, I still have to separate. I still have to split the amount into several times. Several time. Okay. Got it. Now the next one is . Now the next one, who is the owner of this? Can you tell me this me hang hat.[01:19:15] Tell me about the brand though. Yes. So tell me about the brand or other, the same. Either the same or different.[01:19:28] Either the same or different.[01:19:37] So[01:19:42] this is very convenient. We have used that out of Cara blender before N this one is so easy to remove. Okay. And it just so easy to wash the knife. I already like, you know, washing the knife very easy and I can actually use a different program. Program to grind fruit, vegetable,[01:20:15] and, you know, and I think, I can't even use it to Brian eyes for a smoothie as well. Okay. It is wonderful. It is so wonderful. Okay.[01:20:33] And even when I grind a lot of meat. So the ma the brand are still working very well. The blender doesn't become slow. Okay. I used to use it to grind squid and I actually use it to write about two or three kilo of scraped and it could work very well. Okay. Gotcha. Why did you choose the brand, Philip? Why not another brand?[01:20:59] Why Phillips? Any other reason? Well. Before using Phillips, I used one cable rule and I use it for only a few months, and the prime become very weak. And when I, when I asked the technician, the technician said you know, the copper cable a, it become a loser. So then I had to buy another one[01:21:34] and I'm very happy with it. This one because when I watched the bravest one, I would have to get somebody smart brush to brush. So check out, or now the tiny, tiny fine fibers of meat. And then I also have to use hot water and grind, you know, just hard water in the machine in order to remove all of the foot bits left inside.[01:22:01] But this is so easy to remove. This one is so easy. To fall for all of the Pratt to fall apart. Okay. Anything else? And you know, I don't need to use hot water to, to, to clean anymore. It's just so easy. So simple. Okay. Got it. Well understood. P ah ha.[01:22:35] Well, I had the two branders the same are you think the two blenders are different? Because to me they are very similar. I think they are slightly different. I believe they are slightly different. Okay.[01:22:51] Well my one is eight years old, you know? Okay.[01:22:59] Okay. Got it. Got it. So we have to . Phillips users. Let's move on with Alex. What about you?[01:23:14] what about you with aim? I this one come in three different containers. Yeah, three different containers. Okay, and why do you choose this?[01:23:35] Well, this brand is Ganette and you know, when I went to the store, at that time, the sound person was advertising this product and it was also on promotion. Okay. What is far grinding one is for men to say,[01:24:03] and the one with one knife. Only is far grindings dry. And the one in the middle is for menacing meat and the big one is for wet grinding. Okay. And what I like about this one is that there are six buttons. There are six more times.[01:24:30] What I like about this one is that they are six buzzers. Okay.[01:24:37] Why don't want us to, Mmm. Because that's the Essex, but 10 of, so is this very convenient? And so when you punch us, when you punch us in the Salesforce sun demonstrated. Yes. Well, at that time he was demonstrating with three different containers. So I w I find it very interesting and I decided to buy. Okay.[01:25:04] Well understood. Why did you choose a brand called Knight? Apart from the promotion, apart from the price. Any other reason why choosing connect?[01:25:18] Why didn't you as a brand connect?[01:25:23] I like it because of the prime was so cheap. That's the reason why I bought it. Okay, but brand was sewed. You got it. And that's the reason why I bought it.[01:25:40] I bought this one two years ago. The brand was very cheap. It was only a few hundred thousand now. Okay.

So how many scholars would you give this blender over the past two years of using it? Six and a half. Yeah. Six and a half. You reduce the score. Why don't you reduce the squad? Why do you reduce the score? Well. I think it's a little bit difficult to wash.[01:27:05] Yes. First of all, difficult to wash. Anything else? Second on my phone, it's noisy. Second, my phone is very noisy. Okay, well understood. Apart from the noise, is there anything else? Any other reason? Any other reason? It is difficult. It is difficult. Okay. And. What else? Does it save energy? Does it save energy?[01:27:38] The knife is not so sharp. How do they know the knife is not so sharp? Because it type on time. Yeah. It takes more time to grind. Okay. On average, how many minutes did the tattoo to grind? How many minutes.[01:28:02] I don't know, but I feel it takes longer because you know, my friend has a blender and how machine, how Brando go faster. So the next one, the next one is to aim for the aim? Yes. Okay. So apart from these two could attend? No.[01:28:27] Does it also come with any attachment or just these two? No, just. Okay.

For about 10 years ago, you were telling me. Oh, yes, I bought 10 days ago. Okay. And I have to say it's really, really durable. It is that a very durable. Okay. Tell me the reason why you choose a brand shop, not another brand.[01:29:50] At that time, Chuck was very famous, so that's the reason why to shop. Okay. Okay. And it was really, okay. So  last 10 years I've using it. How many score did you give? How many score did you give it? I've hit, I still like it. I get this one. Nice. Go on.

Why don't you like about to, I let the knife, I love the tunability and it actually fit up. This is sortable but you'd be amazed by how much you pay for this one. I don't remember what my husband paid. My husband went to buy any on the reason why. you still like it over the past 10 years.[01:30:51] What else do you like about it now? Give nice score reason why? Why don't you like it this much? I am happy.  about it. Okay. Why don't you reduce one score, reason why you would use one a score.[01:31:13] It doesn't have a lot of, uh, features. It doesn't have a lot of real brands. Okay. It doesn't have a lot of programs. That's right. Okay. I want to have my buttons. Ah, okay. Got it. I want to have. I want to have my buttons N but you want to change to another one?

That's right. Tell me the reason why you chose this.[01:32:50] Anything else.[01:33:00] I bought this one because it was convenient.[01:33:07] and this one also has two programs, which is very convenient. Okay. That's why I chose it. How much do you pay for it? You remember the price?[01:33:23] 1.4 million. Okay. 1.5. Oh, a million, right? What am I, 4 million? Yes. You don't remember the brand[01:33:40] because I don't see, you don't remember the brand, right?[01:33:46] Paso day. A Panasonic bus ride. Okay. You choose because it was kind of Sonic you chose because it was Panasonic.[01:34:00] I chose because of a brand I chose because it was a famous brand and it is durable. That's why I chose it. Okay. Question. you chose because of the brand Panasonic anyhow, the reason for choosing it. Any other reason for choosing it? Nope. Nothing else.[01:34:32] Anything else?

What are you happy about? What are you happy about? Well, it's really quiet. That capacity is pretty nice. The performer is pretty good and it's really convenient to wash. I can I can, I can actually bring all of the parts. Um. I can actually spit on of them. Okay. And it also hides the glass container.[01:35:35] Okay. Is there anything you like less? Is there anything you like less[01:35:47] and it's really quiet and durable, which I really like. Okay. Which I had already liked, but I won't mix the.[01:36:01] Anything else?[01:36:06] Okay, let's move to the last one. Okay. By my Sunday. Yes. This one is . Tell me the reason why I'm better. So name the reason why you choose Panasonic.[01:36:25] Well. How do they feel about this one?[01:36:34] Oh, it looks very nice. This one is very powerful and it's very quiet. Even when I use it in the afternoon when people went home taking a nap, they still can sleep and all of the pop can be detached. Okay. I can actually remove all of them, split all of them, wash all of them. Okay. And I pay 1.6 million for this.[01:37:04] Ah, okay. I pay one a part of saves me Indiana farm days. Okay, so,[01:37:16] so you chose this Brando. Why is Panasonic? It looked very nice, but does not look very nice. Any other reasons for choosing it? Any other reason for choosing it?[01:37:39] You know what, when I brought it to my mom, the rat at my mom house Mitt, the cable.[01:37:57] I have to say that he's nice. Very nice. The only problem I had with this is when the, when the rat MITs the cable, but this one is very beautiful design. I really like it and look very modern. Okay. Got it. Well understood. A little bit. Very modern. The design is nice. How much you pay for it? 1.6 million. 1.6 million.[01:38:26] Yes. Why don't we think about back rise? Is it cheap? Is it expensive or how is just right? Okay. I how the affection, you've been using it for many years. How happy are you with it? How happy are you with it?[01:38:47] I used to spend for two years already, and I really like the design. It looks very modern and beautiful. The knives is that I shop[01:39:00] But nine is very sharp. Okay. And I can even remove the night to wash, can you? Yes, I can remove the knife. Okay. Well understood. What about the, are those, is there any Brando in which you can remove the night?[01:39:27] What did I to give an improvement? No, no, no, no. We're talking about improvement later on. Right on. You will be able to design your own plan though. Okay. So we're going to do it right now. Cool. Is there anything you want to say? Anything you like, anything you dislike about this and let go? No, I'm pretty happy with it.[01:39:52] Okay, so in the next session I would give you . An exercise like ways I want you to imagine, suppose you are allow to create to design a blender. What kind of friend or did you want to design the ideal plan though? Okay. Anything from anything. Okay. What do you think about a blender? How do you want the blender to be the ideal blender for you, for your family?[01:40:23] You have three to five minutes to prep. To discuss together, and I would like to, I like each of you to describe your ideal . Okay. If you to have a well, if you all agree about the idea, we can just present it as a group. Okay. You have three minutes.[01:42:55] Yeah.[01:44:56] Okay. This is the very last exercise. After this exercise, I just have one more question, uh, for you. Then you, Oh, you're going to be free. Okay. Who want to speak first? Who want to present the idea of the idea. Brenda who want to go first? You so can you talk about the ideal blender?[01:45:25] I won the code on features, but I also won an Astro feature, which is makes sense. You want it to be able to mix. Yes. So how should the blender be in order to be able to mix.[01:45:43] When I press the button, it doesn't just, it hasn't Brian, it is a spin to Brian, but it only look and I say stop, turn, turn the food upside down. Turn it from side to side is like gently stirring. I wouldn't have to use my hand to stop.[01:46:04] mixed thing is that of grinding. I want it to be able to mix. Okay, got it. Oh, I'm right. Okay. I'm now that betcha. Mix thing. So do you want to use the same knife or do you want to use a different knife for mixing? I guess they didn't want to mix. I would have to change the knife. Yeah, because it's another function, so it should be another knife.[01:46:36] Well understood. It should be another knife.[01:46:46] It's not simple to start another knife. Ian. I mean, ladies, very simple. Okay. Is there anything else you want to describe? Anything else you want to describe apart from mixing anything else? Nothing else. Okay. Anybody else want to present your idea about the idea one? Okay.[01:47:17] Is there anything else you want to present? I want it to be I boat to pow, find sample. Anything else?[01:47:36] Is there anything else[01:47:40] I want the container to be. Yeah, I want to contend that totally picture, so it is going to be more convenient. Okay. And best. Right. So it's going to be better. It's going to be more convenient. Okay. Well understood. So anybody else? Anybody else? Me? Huh? Okay. Tell me about your idea.[01:48:17] Well, I also think the same as home, so I don't really want the well, contento for medicine me to be bigger, so I don't have to spend a lot of time. I can is that I use it to grind meat, to mix meat. I really want to bins. 200 grand to 300 grams of meat at once. Okay, got it. And who wanna go next? Well, want to go nice.[01:48:54] Me, huh? Okay. Well,[01:49:07] I want the design to be beautiful and. It was her. I also wanted the story feature, so, and if this is able to stop, I don't want to contend to be long and thin. If you know the Fernando is about to stop properly, the contender has to be a different one. Maybe there should be another 10 now is that is specialized fostering.[01:49:37] Okay, well understood. And.[01:49:47] And you know, the small contend now that I'm using to to grind something dry now, I don't really want to be able to contend more. Hey, I really, at the moment, whenever I grind something without water, I have to check it by my hands. And I know for all of the, all of the content inside to be thoroughly grabbed.[01:50:11] So probably I don't really want to, something like this is gonna. It's gonna grind towards the method side five times and then it's going to rotate right towards the horizon OSI Phi times. So it going to go by and forth. In that case, I don't really have to check the container anymore. Okay, got it. Well, what are going next?[01:50:36] Me? So why don't you want.[01:50:42] Aim, what do you want?[01:50:50] I want a different size of container. So probably, you know, one vendor should come to gather with three contenders. Two containers. Okay. Because you know, there would be different family sizes, a family of two and a family of three. You see. A family of five, etc. Etc. So I can actually grind, you know, different different amount of meat.[01:51:21] It's easy for us to choose, is it for the hash to choose. Okay. And also I also wanted it to be energy efficient. How do you know if it's energy efficient? It should have in butter and it should have inverter five sample. Okay. So, and I wanted the capacity, I wanted the, the both fall mums to be energy efficient.[01:51:49] I used every day, first of all, it should have been boater. Just slide the air conditioner. That's right. And she had been locked up. That's right. Okay. And now the affection. last person, last person. So you've been listening to unmodified years. So when I do think,[01:52:18] first of all, I want the small container for dry riding to be bigger. I really want the night to be able to remove.[01:52:37] I really want to be able to remove the knife. To wash. So there would be nothing stuck in due to the knife and the machine,[01:52:49] and I can use up all of the meat I have. Okay. Got it. So then I would feel more sure. And what am I saying? I also wanted the container to be glass[01:53:08] and for the night. One Spanish steel knife at the moment, the knife I already sell is still okay. Anything else[01:53:22] at the moment? The blender is very, very, very good on ready. Okay. Well, another question.[01:53:31] So some people like the container to be plastic, some want to be glass. What do you want. For the idea one, what are you once drastic plastic. How many light plastic? Raise your hand.[01:53:50] Who did I blast? Raise your hand. Three people. Four people like glass. Yes, that's right. And, but glass is very heavy. That's right. It's actually very, very hazy.[01:54:06] Class is very heavy. Maybe, you know, we would have a, a glass container and also a backup plastic container as well. That's right. As a backup. Ah, okay. So black is good, but if you know it come, it also should come with a plastic container as a . That's right. So if you can choose   or plastic container, which one would you prefer.[01:54:40] I think glass is safer. Yeah. Glass is safer. Anything else? Plus it's safer. Okay, so that is actually,[01:55:03] so there's actually a big container, a small container. Anything else for you? One . Yeah. But any attachment you want.[01:55:13] Do you want the do you also want, you know, the story too and like some of the some available in the market right now? It's nice to have, but actually with the story too, it might go more complicated. Okay.[01:55:34] It's fine. We'll let us go into it. That's right.  tune. That tool should be small to make it not complicated and annoying. Okay.[01:55:53] So at the moment some of them come with a certain tune, right. And that starting tool is attached with , right? Yes. You know, there's a it and in the middle. It's a test study tool. So where do you  your work and actually stop you and that in your ideal a blender? It's nice to have. It does. Nice to have, but I don't really want the story tool to be just compact, compact, small.[01:56:28] That's right. Small compact. That's right. Okay.[01:56:36] And anything else. Do you want it to be small or you want it to be what? I want it to be suitable. Yeah. And I want it to come together right inside. Well understood. And I want it to be right you to side pass. Right. Well understood. Okay. In terms of brand, what are the products available level in the market that can make the ideal blend, including whatever.[01:57:07] You want sofa? What brand can my kid, Phillips Phillips was going to make this shock and Mickey Palestinian so they can make it an any other brothers you want[01:57:22] this run has a strength. It's Brad actually had has a strength. What brand can you think of? Oh, play another venture in the market nowadays. What brand? Um, kind of produce the ideal blender that you want fit is Phillip's going to make it. That's right. Past the name can make it for those can make it. Got it.[01:57:50] Any brands? Any other brands? Okay.[01:57:56] What about T fan? Someone medicine T fan to fan? Um.[01:58:10] Right?[01:58:14] Because you know, me and my sister, we are using two different brands,[01:58:27] but you know, actually what a grind meat, the meat well have very, very strong machine smell. Okay. The fry fat is very, very cheap. Okay. So then it's more is better, sir. And so do you think Stefan can map the ideal plan though that you want? Can TFL met the ideal blender possible? I ability fan. Can they leave all the features I want?[01:58:59] But I think the good thing about fan is that I can remove the knife.[01:59:08] But you know, because the night is so close to the bottom of the container, that's why there's always me stop there. But in terms of the function ability fan, Kelly lever, the function. Okay,[01:59:30] well the thing I dislike about T fan is that the knife of  is really, really close to the bottom.[01:59:38] But to find those, deliver those functions. Okay. What about shop? Why did the brand news shop, you think shop can do it? Yes. Sharp is a modern brand. Shaft can do it. Yes, but what about those Shabbat? Well, she bought a candle with yes, though she back and also do it. Okay. The last question I want to ask and.[02:00:06] Nowadays at home nowadays. you do, you also have the, you also have the head Mmm. Processor. You know the hand Mesa. Do you know[02:00:25] with me, I followed at the moment that you have the head blender, but you have the head planner. Hey, Brenda, did you know?[02:00:41] Okay. Question.[02:00:49] So anyone here had the hand blender one person? Yes. Okay. What about the others? Well, what about the others? Why don't you have it. But you understand, you know what I am talking about the hand blender. Okay. The hand blender. Yeah. Is that the one in the wet market? The one we use for blending pumper blending, some basic stuff, but it's not machine it actually, but you know, the one and the wet market, the one that they mixed.[02:01:35] But you know the headband is smaller? Yes. Okay. Those who don't have that hand planned, I hope, but don't you have it? Why don't you have it?[02:01:50] I actually have the pepper blender. You know, the fact that Brenda has a function, it can actually be use to blend pepper. Okay, but you think the head blender is still useful. Why don't you think what I had planned though? Is this useful?[02:02:13] That is only for pepper. I do have the pepper blender. Well, understood. Yes. That is the hand blender, right? Yes. Okay. Well understood. So what are you talking about? Which one are you talking about? Why don't you have at home? Tell me the one you had. What is it? I know I have the blend up fat in which I have to use head.[02:02:42] I can actually use it to blend well. Fruit has, well, you have a blender, you have the electric blender, but you still have the head Lander reason. Well,[02:03:01] first of all, I've been using this Brando. For 15 years and the head blender I received as a gift and it was so difficult to wash the head blender. Okay. Anything else? Is there anything else?[02:03:24] Is that a thing that I had planned? Oh, can do, but the current electric Brando cannot do. Okay.[02:03:34] That's your friend that is more convenient,[02:03:39] but whenever we know we have a blackout, I can use the head blender. Ah, okay. Got it. Cut a check. Rick Fletcher. Is that a neat that the electric blender cannot meet and you want the electric planner to be improved? Last question. Is there any needs that you think the current one cannot meet.[02:04:11] I want to mix it. How about another, uh,  mode, which just makes sense. Okay. Apart from that, is there anything else that  cannot give and you need improvement to self? You better?[02:04:28] No, it's been very okay. It's been okay? Yes. Actually, I finish my question. Thank you very much. We are in the middle of a crisis. I really appreciate your participation, so I really hope that you're gonna be healthy and safe. Thank you very much. So now I'm going to hand you get a sedative and I called you want to be safe and healthy.[02:04:59] Thank you.[02:05:20] Yeah.[MOU1]interpreter dịch ngược, đã sửa theo audio tiếng Việt
